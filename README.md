# airline_safety_analysis
In this research I want to find how to know if an airline is safe. Should we trust companies that have had fatal crashes in the past — even when the crashes don’t appear to be their fault? Or are crashes essentially random events? This research based on safety records for major commercial airlines from 30 years (since 1985 - 2014). Data are divided into two time intervals of 15 years. Data includes information about rate of incidents as listed in the database, whether or not they resulted in a fatality, rate of fatal accidents, rate of fatalities among passengers and crew on the airline.

First I’ll look to see whether there was a correlation in crash rates from one half of the data set to the other. If we identify a correlation, that will imply that crash risk is persistent — predictable to some extent based on the airline. Then I'll calculate the airline safety rating. Numbers < 0 will mean that the airline's safety is low.
